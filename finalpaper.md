## 1. Introduction<a name="1"></a>

Precision Medicine essentially defines a new medical model; one that utilizes factors such as an individual's environment as well as there genetic makeup in order to determine medical decisions, practices, interventions, and products. It recognizes that a disease may be characterized by a similar set of symptoms - yet the mechanisms behind those symptoms may differ from person to person. 

Here is a brief introductory video about the concept of Precision Medicine [1]:

The characteristics of an individual that are important to Precision Medicine can be grouped into two categories.<br>

**Genetics**
> The genome sequence includes variations and mutations. The specific combination of these variations in an individual can lead to differences in the way a biological process occurs. For example, if a person has a mutation in a gene for a protein in a certain pathway, the pathway may not function properly and may lead to a disease.

**Environment**
> Environmental factors, especially UV exposure and smoking cigarettes, may lead to mutations in the genome. The epigenome, which affects the expression of genes, is also shaped by an individual's environment.

## 2. Asthma<a name="2"></a>

Asthma is an allergic condition that affects the lungs, and is characterized by intermittent symptoms such as coughing, wheezing, and chest tightness [2]. In a normal lung, the muscles in the airway are smooth and relaxed. However, in an asthmatic subject, the muscles are tightened, swollened, or inflamed, leading to an increased production of mucus and obstruction of the airway.

Studying asthma from a Precision Medicine lens is particularly important because researchers have contended that the disease is heterogeneous, and is largely affected by environmental variables [2]. With an estimated 300 million people that suffer from asthma, it is important to understand the different underlying mechanisms that cause the disease and treat individuals accordingly.

#### 1) Phenotype Classification<a name="31"></a>

The first application we are going to explore is separating asthma subjects into groups based on phenotype.

#### 2) Classification through Differential Gene Expression Analysis<a name="32"></a>

Beyond just looking at phenotype, we can go a step further by using Bioinformatic techniques such as RNA-seq. 

In a paper by Seumois et al. in The Journal of Immunology (2016), they aim to determine differentially expressed genes between asthma and rhinitis.
