## 1. Introduction<a name="1"></a>

Precision Medicine essentially defines a new medical model; one that utilizes factors such as an individual's environment as well as there genetic makeup in order to determine medical decisions, practices, interventions, and products. It recognizes that a disease may be characterized by a similar set of symptoms - yet the mechanisms behind those symptoms may differ from person to person. 

Here is a brief introductory video about the concept of Precision Medicine [1]:

The characteristics of an individual that are important to Precision Medicine can be grouped into two categories.<br>
**Genetics**
> The genome sequence includes variations and mutations. The specific combination of these variations in an individual can lead to differences in the way a biological process occurs. For example, if a person has a mutation in a gene for a protein in a certain pathway, the pathway may not function properly and may lead to a disease.

**Environment**
> Environmental factors, especially UV exposure and smoking cigarettes, may lead to mutations in the genome. The epigenome, which affects the expression of genes, is also shaped by an individual's environment.

## 2. Asthma<a name="2"></a>

Asthma is an allergic condition that affects the lungs, and is characterized by intermittent symptoms such as coughing, wheezing, and chest tightness [2]. In a normal lung, the muscles in the airway are smooth and relaxed. However, in an asthmatic subject, the muscles are tightened, swollened, or inflamed, leading to an increased production of mucus and obstruction of the airway.
